* `https://example.com/.well-known/acct-image?resource=acct:reiver@mastodon.social`

### acct-cache

The `acct-cache` style URL returns the (cached) activity-JSON (`application/activity+json`) file for the account.

### acct-icon

The `acct-icon` style URL redirects to the icon-url for the account, as provided in (cached) activity-JSON (`application/activity+json`) file.

You can put this type of URL into an HTML `<img>` element.
For example:

```html
<img src="https://example.com/.well-known/acct-icon?resource=acct:reiver@mastodon.social" />
```

### acct-image

The `acct-image` style URL redirects to the image-url for the account, as provided in (cached) activity-JSON (`application/activity+json`) file.

You can put this type of URL into an HTML `<img>` element.
For example:

```html
<img src="https://example.com/.well-known/acct-image?resource=acct:reiver@mastodon.social" />
```

## Fediverse ID

A **Fediverse ID** (i.e., **Fediverse Address**), such as:

`@reiver@mastodon.social`

Can be turned into an acct-URI â€” by replacing the first `@` with `acct:`, as in:

`acct:reiver@mastodon.social`
